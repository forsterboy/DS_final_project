A. Models comparison

We can now compare our models and to choose the best one for our problem.

The model score is the coefficient of determination R2 of the prediction. In total, we have examinated 5 models to train/predict the used cars price.





We split our dataset into training, testing data with a 80:20 split ratio.



we applied and examinated 5 ML models on the preprocessed dataset with features as inputs and the price as output


By applying 5 models, the GradientBoostingRegressor gives good results with 99.1% on training set and 96.2% accuracy on prediction.


has the highest accuracy percentage
GradientBoostingRegressor gives the BEST accuracy in comparison to all prior works using these datasets. > ?
