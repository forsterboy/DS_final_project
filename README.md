1. Data Collection and Processing:
		We start by loading the car dataset and performing initial data exploration. We check the dataset’s dimensions, data types, and missing values, gaining insights into its structure and contents.
2. Encoding Categorical Data:
		We encode categorical variables such as ‘fuelType’, ‘model’, and ‘transmission’ into numerical representations, preparing the dataset for machine learning algorithms.
3. Splitting the Data
		We split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y) and further divided it into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
4. Model Training and Evaluation:
		We train 4 machine learning models, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression... on the training data and evaluated their performance on both training and testing sets.
		For each model, we calculate the R squared error to assess how well the model’s predictions align with the actual car prices.
5. Visualizing Results:
		We visualize the relationship between the actual car prices and the prices predicted by our models, providing insights into their accuracy and generalization ability.
6. Conclusion:
		Our journey into car price prediction using machine learning techniques has provided valuable insights into the predictive power of data-driven models in the automotive industry. By leveraging advanced algorithms and robust data analysis, we can develop accurate and reliable models to forecast car prices effectively.
